    title: "Taking a Moment to Celebrate: My Full Stack Bootcamp Journey",
    date: "March 9, 2025",
    content: `
      It's been a while since I graduated from the MigraCode Full Stack bootcamp, but only now have I had the time to reflect on the course and on some life lessons I've learned.
      One key realization is how important it is to properly celebrate achievements without immediately looking ahead, feeling unsatisfied, or frustrated by the work that still needs to be done. 
      It took me 9 months of dedicated effort, including early morning wakeups to make it to Saturday classes on time. I have to admit, it was never a burden because I was fortunate to be surrounded by an amazing group and supportive teachers! 
      With this post, I want to mark this important milestone and take a moment to feel happy and proud of how much I accomplished last year!`,

## Research Goals for Portfolio Website Redesign

The purpose of this research is to better understand the needs, expectations, and pain points of people who visit my design portfolio, 
so I can redesign it to be clearer, more persuasive, and more user-centered.

### Goals:

- Understand what information **recruiters** and **hiring managers** look for first when evaluating a design portfolio (strongest projects, design process, outcomes, role in team)
- Identify what makes a portfolio feel credible and memorable to **potential employers** (visual design, storytelling, unique voice, clarity)
- Explore common pain points or frustrations when reviewing online portfolios (navigation issues, clutter, too much text, missing context)
- Discover what persuades visitors to contact the designer or learn more (clear call to action, accessible contact info, compelling about page)
- Learn how **peer designers** and **mentors** evaluate portfolios differently from recruiters (feedback focus, process depth, craft vs. business impact)

## Research scope:

- **Target users / audience segments:**
  - Recruiters / HR:
    - Product companies (large / mid-size)
    - Digital agencies
    - Startups
  - Hiring managers / design leads
  - Peer designers / mentors
- **Methods:** user interviews (primary), competitive review of other portfolios (secondary)
